# Apache Iceberg™ C++

## Overview

iceberg-cpp is a C++ implementation of [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/), an open table format for large analytic datasets. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and catalog integrations required to read, write, and manage Iceberg tables from C++ applications or engines.

## Key Features

- **Modern C++23** — Built with ranges, concepts, `std::expected`, and other modern idioms
- **Cross-Platform** — Builds and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Spec Compliance** — Full table spec support today; Puffin, View, and UDF specs are on the roadmap
- **Arrow-Native** — Uses the Arrow C Data Interface as the primary data API
- **Easy Engine Integration** — Interface-oriented, pluggable design for Catalog, FileIO, FileFormat, and more
- **Battery-Included** — Deep integration with Apache Arrow for columnar layout and rich file system support
- **REST Catalog Client** — Connects to any Iceberg REST catalog with pluggable authentication
- **File Format Support** — Built-in readers and writers for Apache Parquet and Apache Avro
